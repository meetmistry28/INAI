            <h2 id="what-is-ai">The Power of Machines That Learn</h2>
            <p>From smart voice assistants like Alexa or Siri to new discoveries in hospitals, AI and ML are being used everywhere. In this blog, you'll learn how these intelligent technologies are transforming the world around us, one innovation at a time. If you're new to AI and want to understand how it all works, check out our <a href="/blog/what-is-artificial-intelligence" style={{ color: 'skyblue', textDecorationLine: 'underline' }}>beginner’s guide to Artificial Intelligence to learn the core concepts</a> in simple terms.</p>


            <h2 id="how-ai-works">What Makes AI and ML So Special?</h2>
            <p>AI and ML are powerful technologies that help machines learn from data, recognize patterns, and make smart decisions without human help. They improve over time with new information, continuously learning and adapting to deliver better results with each update. This makes them ideal for solving complex problems quickly and accurately. Their ability to adapt and get smarter with experience sets them apart. AI and ML can analyze large data sets faster than humans and continue learning on their own.
