            <h2 id="introduction">The Reality Behind AI Learning Today</h2>
            <p>AI and ML are more than just buzzwords now — they're reshaping how businesses, industries, and even governments function. Every aspiring AI engineer, data scientist, or ML enthusiast dreams of contributing to this evolution.</p>
            <p>But here’s the harsh truth: Certifications alone won’t get you there.</p>
            <p>What employers and startups truly want today is proof you can apply what you’ve learned — and that only comes from real-world, hands-on project experience.</p>
            <p>In this blog, we’ll explore why doing an AI/ML internship with real projects in Surat is far more valuable than stacking up online certificates, and how you can stand out in India’s competitive AI landscape.</p>


            <h2 id="what-is-ai">Why Certifications Alone Aren’t Enough Anymore</h2>
            <p>Certifications can help you understand concepts — but that’s not the same as knowing how to build a real AI model. Here's why:</p>


            <p className='blog_pad'><b>• No real datasets</b> - Most online courses use clean, pre-labeled datasets.</p>
            <p className='blog_pad'><b>• No team collaboration</b> - You don’t experience product workflows.</p>
            <p className='blog_pad'><b>• No version control or deployment</b> - Concepts like model tuning, testing, or deploying on real servers are missing.</p>
            <p className='blog_pad'><b>• No feedback loop</b> - Real mentorship, code reviews, and iteration cycles are essential.</p>


            <h2>The Power of Product-Based AI Internships</h2>


            <p>Working on a real AI tool that actually gets used by businesses or users.</p>

            <p>That’s the core of a product-based AI internship — you don’t just "learn", you build:</p>

            <p className='blog_pad'> • Real data pipelines</p>
            <p className='blog_pad'> • Functional ML models</p>
            <p className='blog_pad'> • Performance-optimized modules</p>

            <p>Instead of theoretical assignments, you become part of a real AI development team writing code that ships.</p>
